> **Source:** CCHQ_formatted.docx — Chapter 9: Online Shopping Fraud.

> **Risk level:** High | **Priority:** P2

## Initial Triage

```
IF complaint received
THEN record complaint and verify it discloses a cognizable cyber offence

IF financial loss is recent (immediate window)
THEN execute immediate response: First Hour Response; Preserve website URLs; Preserve seller profile links; Preserve transaction records; Preserve screenshots; Preserve communications; Report through Cyber Helpline; Register complaint on NCRP

IF FIR criteria satisfied
THEN register FIR and assign investigating officer
```

## Evidence Collection Decisions

```
IF victim holds screenshots / chats / messages
THEN preserve them and record hash + chain of custody

IF physical device is available (mobile / computer / storage)
THEN perform mobile forensics with write blockers, forensic imaging and hash verification

IF original media / source files exist
THEN seize originals (not copies) and preserve metadata
```

## Financial Investigation Decisions

```
IF transaction IDs / UTR / payment records available
THEN conduct financial trail analysis

IF beneficiary account identified
THEN initiate account freeze (debit + credit) and request transaction-trail preservation from the bank

IF recoverable funds / assets still held
THEN pursue documented recovery measures: Account freezing, Fund trail analysis, Beneficiary tracing
```

## Platform Investigation Decisions

```
IF crime conducted via an online platform / website / app
THEN issue preservation request to the platform for login history, IP logs and device information

IF IP / domain / server lead obtained
THEN perform attribution (IP tracing, domain/server investigation) and onward telecom/ISP follow-up
```

## Escalation Decisions

```
IF additional third-party records required
THEN issue preservation / production requests to banks, telecom operators and platforms

IF suspect not yet attributable
THEN continue technical attribution (device, telecom, IP, financial linkage) before closure/escalation
```

## Arrest & Prosecution Decisions

```
IF suspect identified
THEN conduct search and seizure and effect arrest as warranted

IF seized devices / records obtained
THEN complete forensic examination and evidence correlation

IF evidentiary chain established
THEN prepare charge sheet including: Documentary Evidence, Complaint records, Transaction records, Seller details, Platform responses, Digital Evidence, Website records, Login logs, Communication records, Device reports

IF charge sheet to be framed
THEN apply the chapter's documented Relevant Laws (IT Act / BNS / BSA / BNSS and special statutes)

IF prosecution proceeds
THEN establish: False representation by seller; Intentional deception; Fraudulent inducement of payment; Non-delivery or misrepresentation of goods/services; Financial loss suffered by victim; Digital linkage between accused and transaction; Benefit obtained by accused
